Timepiece is centered around the CRUD (create, read, update and delete) functionality and has been created using Django framework system for creating the application using jinja notation, HTML, CSS, JS and Python. The features I want to implement to this app, as follows:

* CRUD opeations to allow users interaction with the app
* Functionality to allow users to purchase products from our website
* Functionality to allow users to view products
* Functionality to allow users to view blog post and comment on blogs
* Functionality to allow super users to add, edit and delete products from the store
* Functionality to allow users to search fproducts
* Functionality to allow users to create an account
* Responsive design and beautiful looking application on all devices

## Structure

* Products will be stored in the app on the Products page for all users to view. Each product has a product detail page which can be viewed by clicing on the specific product card/link in the products view
* Users will be able to search for products via either the name of a product or key words from the description of the products on the website
* Users will be able to add items to their basket, edit and remove products from their basket via easy to use navigation buttons
* Store owners will be able to edit or delete products via simple and easy to use buttons on the products and products details page
